# Statements and Values: print statement ouputs value of 5
print 5
print 5.5
print 'hello cows'

# Type function tells us the data type of an object
print type(5)     #output tells us 5 is an 'int' value, an integer

print type(5.5)   #output tells us 5.5 is a 'float' value, floating-point

print type('hello cows')  #output tells us "hello world" is a 'str' value, string


# Variables: use an assignment statement to create a new variable and give it a value

n = 5
pi = 3.1415926535897931
message = 'hello cows'

print message   #prints the value of message, which is the str 'hello world'
print n     #prints the value of n, which is the int 5
print pi    #prints the value of pi, which is the float 3.121 ...

# Functions: there are built-in functions and custom functions.  We used the type() function above,
# a built in function.

# Another is the input() function, for integers, and the raw_input() function for strings

# Math functions are provided by the math module (imported at top of this file)

print math.pi   #the name of the math module is specified first, and then the
                # pi function is called using the . (dot notation)

print math.cos(60)  #calls the cos method of the math module and passes the
                    #int 60 as an argument


# New functions can be build using a function definition

def sayHello():
    print 'hello cows'

sayHello()   #this line calls the sayHello function

#Function return values can also be assigned to a variable:

def sayHello():
    return 'hello cows'
    
a = sayHello()
print a


# We can also pass arguments to a function, which are then used as parameters within the function

def saySomething(word):
    print word          #in this case, whatever is passed to the saySomething
                        #function will be printed

saySomething ('hello world again')      #statement calls the saySomething function and passes
                                        #the str 'hello world again' as an argument

def saySomething2(word, num):
    print word,             #comma keeps output of next line on same line
    print num*2

# Conditional statements check conditions and change the behavior of the program

j = 2
k = 3
if j > k:           #if statements are structured in a similar way as functions
    print 'j is greater than k'
elif j < k:         #elif statement used to chain conditions together
    print 'j is less than k'
else:               #else clause must be used at end only
    print 'j and k are equal'
	
# You can use keywords to test multiple comparisons at once

if j > 1 and j < 3:
	print 'j is 2'
	
if k < 1 or k > 2:
	print 'k is not 2'
